# Matrix

Matrix is <a href="https://matrix.org">an open network for secure, decentralised communication</a>. It’s a really nice chat protocol based on a federation model, and there are <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/">a number of clients</a> available.

We run our own homeserver, which lives at matrix.omg.lol (but accounts use the omg.lol hostname). You can have an account on our homeserver, or use an existing account on another server. We have an omg.lol “space” with a bunch of rooms (see below), all of which are bridged to our IRC and Discord servers.

### Getting Started

To join, visit your address’s social.lol page. In the Matrix section, you’ll see two options: you can create a Matrix account on our homeserver for your omg.lol address, or you can invite your existing account from another instance to the omg.lol space. Click whichever button you wish, wait a couple of moments, and you’ll be good to go.

### Rules

Use common sense when chatting with others. Prioritize kindness. Show compassion. Remember that all omg.lol policies apply on Matrix, like our [Code of Conduct](/info/code-of-conduct), [Terms of Use](/info/legal), and [Acceptable Use](/info/legal) policies. Just [don’t be an asshole](https://asshole.fyi) and you should be fine.

### Connecting

To use Matrix, you need a _client_ that can connect to the _server_. There are [many clients](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients) available, all with different features.

When connecting to our homeserver, be sure to use the address `matrix.omg.lol`. Your address will be `@username:omg.lol`, but if you enter `omg.lol` your client probably won’t be able to find the server (since it technically lives at `matrix.omg.lol`).

### Channels

We host these rooms in the omg.lol space on our homeserver:

  * **#general**, general chatter about anything
  * **#random**, random or off-the-wall stuff
  * **#help**, customer service and support
  * **#omg.lol**, chat about omg.lol services
  * **#web**, web development stuff
  * **#email**, all about email
  * **#dns**, for the nerds
  * **#mastodon**, discuss Mastodon (social.lol or in general)
  * **#firehose**, notices, announcements, inbound webhooks, and other noisy (but interesting) stuff

You can also create your own rooms or join some that others have created.
