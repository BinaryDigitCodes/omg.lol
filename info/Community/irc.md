# Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

Internet Relay Chat (or IRC) is an open standard for chatting on the internet. It‚Äôs [been around forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), and it‚Äôs great! And we‚Äôre using it here as part of our [social.lol](/help/social.lol) platform.

### Getting Started

To kick things off, visit your address's social.lol page and then click the "Create IRC account" button. You‚Äôll then receive a password that you can use when connecting.

### Connecting

To use IRC, you need a _client_ that can connect to the _server_. There are [many clients](/info/extra/irc-clients) available, all with different features.

You can point any client at `irc.social.lol` (port `6667` for a plaintext connection, or port `6697` for a secure connection). Be sure to configure your connection with a server password (using the same password provided when you created your account) to authenticate when connecting. If you don‚Äôt include a password, Penelope will disconnect you. üòü

**If you keep getting disconnected when you join**, be sure to confirm that you‚Äôre connecting with the correct name (your omg.lol address), and that you‚Äôre including the correct server password in your client configuration. Also note that you won‚Äôt be able to connect from two different clients at the same time (the second connection won‚Äôt be able to authenticate because your nick is in use by the first). So if you‚Äôre experimenting with different clients, be sure to disconnect from one before trying another!

### Hiding your IP address

If you‚Äôd like to hide your connection details, you can request a _vhost_¬†or _virtual hostname_. Just ask our friendly bot, penelope, in any channel she‚Äôs in: `!vhost [vhost]`, where `[vhost]` is whatever virtual hostname you‚Äôd like to use. You can be pretty creative here.

### Channels

Here are some of the popular channels on the server:

  * **#general**, for general chatter about anything
  * **#random**, for random, off-the-wall stuff
  * **#help**, for customer service and support
  * **#omg.lol**, for assistance with omg.lol or related services
  * **#web**, for web development, profile customization, or whatever other webby thing you might want to chat about
  * **#email**, for discussion of one of the best things about the internet
  * **#dns**, why would anyone want to join this channel?
  * **#mastodon**, for discussion about Mastodon (social.lol or anything else)
  * **#firehose**, for notices, announcements, inbound webhooks, and other noisy but interesting stuff

You can also create your own channels or join some that other have created. To view a list of all channels in use, type `/list`.

### Commands

IRC uses ‚Äúslash commands‚Äù to do things. You can [view a complete list of commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands), but here are a few that you‚Äôll want to know:

  * `/join #channel` joins a channel
  * `/part #channel` leaves a channel
  * `/msg [person] [message]` sends a private message (e.g. `/msg adam wanna hear a joke?`)

### NickServ

If you somehow weren‚Äôt registered with NickServ when you first set things up (maybe you joined before we set up this slick automatic setup thing), you can register by sending a message to NickServ like this: `/msg NickServ register [password] [email]`. NickServ will let you know if that worked.

### Rules

Use common sense when chatting with others. Prioritize kindness. Show compassion. Remember that all omg.lol policies apply on irc.social.lol, like our [Code of Conduct](/info/code-of-conduct), [Terms of Use](/info/legal), and [Acceptable Use](/info/legal) policies. Just [don‚Äôt be an asshole](https://asshole.fyi) and you should be fine.
