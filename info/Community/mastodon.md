# Mastodon

We run a Mastodon instance on [social.lol](https://social.lol), and all omg.lol members are welcome to join. You can create a new account on your address’s social.lol page.

Mastodon is kind of like Twitter, only nicer. For a more thorough description, [read all about Mastodon here](https://joinmastodon.org).

You can follow us (well, Prami) on Mastodon at [@prami@social.lol](https://social.lol/@prami).

## If your address expires

If your omg.lol address, you’ll have 14 days to export your data and migrate your Mastodon account to another instance (if you want to, that is).

After 14 days, your Masotdon account will be defederated and all data will be deleted. At that point, it will become available to the next person who purchases the omg.lol address.
