# Mastodon

We run a Mastodon instance on [social.lol](https://social.lol), and all omg.lol members are welcome to join. You can create a new account on your address's social.lol page page.

Mastodon is kind of like Twitter, only much nicer. For a much better description, [read all about Mastodon here](https://joinmastodon.org).

You can follow us on Mastodon at [@omgdotlol@social.lol](https://social.lol/@omgdotlol).

## If your address expires

In the event of your address expiring, we will give you a window to move your Mastodon account and export your data.

<div class="container yellow-2-bg gray-9-fg">

This hasn't happened in practise yet so we don't know exactly how long it will be, but we'll figure something out.

</div>

After you've exported everything, your account will be removed in a way that fully de-federates the account, removing all followers and other data.
