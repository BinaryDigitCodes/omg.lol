# Billing

Here’s some info on how we manage billing matters.

## Frequency

Buying an omg.lol address is a lot like buying any other domain: it’s something that you’d ideally want to hold onto for a while (if not forever!), so monthly billing isn’t really as appropriate as it might be with other services.

## Subscriptions

We don’t use a traditional subscription model here. We don’t retain your billing information, and we don’t do automatic renewals. Honeslty, we think those things are kind of annoying. If you’ve ever had a subscription to something that you don’t want anymore (but that you’ve forgotten about) and it auto-renewed, it’s not a great feeling. We don’t want to make anyone feel that way.

On the flip side, missing a renewal deadline can be stressful. We’ll contact you a few times before your address expires to ensure that you have ample opportunity to renew it if you wish to keep it.

## Payments

See the [Payments](/info/payments) article for information on accepted payment methods and making payments.

## Card/Bank Charges

The payment method that you use to purchase omg.lol services will be charged by “omg.lol”, “omg.lol Address”, or ”Neatnik LLC” (or, more likely, an all-caps version of one of those). If you ever have a problem with any omg.lol charges, [let us know](/info/contact) at any time and we’ll help clear things up right away.
