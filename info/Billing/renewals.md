# Renewals & Expiration

Renewing your omg.lol address is easy! You can add time to your address at any time. Just pull it up and you’ll see the option on your address page.

As we mention in our [Billing](/info/billing) article, there is no automatic renewal associated with your omg.lol address. We don’t retain your payment information. You’re always in control with your renewals.

## Renewal 

In the past, we only sent one renewal notification 30 days before your address expired. Now, we send three:

1. The first one is 60 days before expiration.
2. The second is 30 days before expiration.
3. The third and final notification is 14 days before expiration.

## Expiration

When addresses expire, there’s an additional 30 day grace period before it’s expunged. We’ll send one final message 7 days before your address is scheduled to be expunged.

Expunged addresses become available for others to purchase immediately.
