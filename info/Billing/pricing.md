# Pricing

omg.lol addresses cost just $20 per year.

You can register an address for periods between one to ten years. You can also add between one and ten years of time to your address at any time (just visit your [address page](https://home.omg.lol/addresses), and you’ll see a button you can click to add more time).

## Gift Codes

Gift codes are a convenient (and fun!) way to share omg.lol with anyone. Gift codes don’t expire, so after being purchased they can be redeemed at any point in the future.

They cost the same as a regular omg.lol address registration ($20/year) and can also be purchased in periods of 1 to 10 years.
