# IRC Clients

If you want to use our IRC server, you’ll need to connect with a client. Our [IRC server article](/info/community/irc) talks all about how to get connected, but if you’re wondering what client to use, you can start here.

Since IRC has been around for a while, there are [a ton of clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) out there. This article will focus on ones that members of our community use.

## irssi

[irssi](https://irssi.org) is a classic terminal-friendly client. Simple but powerful (as most terminal stuff goes).

## WeeChat

[WeeChat](https://weechat.org) is another terminal-friendly client that’s extremely flexible.

## Quassel

[Quassel](https://quassel-irc.org) is a cross-platform client with a unique client/core model. In addition to the client connecting directly to the IRC server, you can also set up a “core” that will maintain a connection to the server, and then your client(s) can connect to that core. This makes it easy to maintain a persistent connection and to easily use multiple different devices.

## IRCCloud

[IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/) is a service that offers a persistent cloud connection to the IRC server, a web interface, mobile apps, and a built-in bouncer (so you can also connect with any other client you’d like). It costs $50/year, but configuration is straightforward and the service is slick.
