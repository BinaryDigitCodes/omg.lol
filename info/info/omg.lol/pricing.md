# Pricing

omg.lol addresses are just $5 per year. (But not for long!)

You can register an address for periods of one to ten years. You can also add between one and ten years of time to your address at any time (just visit your [billing page](/account/billing)).

## Gift Codes

Gift codes are a convenient (and fun!) way to share omg.lol with anyone. Gift codes don’t expire, so after being purchased they can be redeemed at any point in the future. 

They cost the same as a regular omg.lol address registration ($5/year) and can be purchased in registration terms of 1 to 10 years.
