# Address requirements

You can register any address that would be a valid second-level domain name. In plain English, this means it can contain:
	
* ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z)
* Digits (0-9)
* Dashes (-), but the address canâ€™t start or end with a hyphen

You can also register [emoji addresses](/info/emoji-addresses), though those are a little more technically complicated.
