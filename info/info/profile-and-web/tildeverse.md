# The Tildeverse

While we’re not quite full-blown members of the *official* [Tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org), omg.lol is pleased to offer a sort of Tilde Lite™ experience for our members. Everyone has a special “tilde” version of their profile page (such as `omg.lol/~foo`) which provides a tilde-like viewing experience. You can change the behavior of this page by changing its route on your [Switchboard](/help/switchboard) if you’d like.
