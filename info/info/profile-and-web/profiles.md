# Profiles

You can have a super awesome profile page on omg.lol. Enable yours by pulling up your address, clicking **Manage Profile**, and switching it on.

## Getting Started

First thing to know: all profile fields are 100% optional. Fill out as much or as little as you’d like!

Your profile is broken down into two main sections. **The Basics** is where you can provide some simple information about yourself (name, pronouns, a picture, etc.). **Profile Items** is where you can go to town and have a blast adding as many things about yourself as you’d like.

There’s a super powerful (we might even say _magical_) management process behind [Profile Items](/info/profile-items), so they have their [very own support article over here](/info/profile-items).

## Verified Profiles

We offer a simple process for [profile verification](/info/profile-verification). Want to show the world that you are in fact who you say you are? [Contact us](/info/contact) to start the verification process.
