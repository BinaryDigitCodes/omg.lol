# omg.lol & Fastmail

We’re really into email, and we deeply value privacy. So, naturally, we absolutely love [Fastmail](http://fastmail.com/omglol/). Fastmail is what we use for our personal email—for nearly a decade now!—and it’s so easy to recommend because it’s _that_ good.

With Fastmail, you can take your omg.lol service to the next level and actually **send email** from your @omg.lol email address. It only takes a few seconds to set up, and you’ll get fully hosted email that’s private, reliable, and, yes, _fast_. Check out [the full list of features](https://www.fastmail.com/omglol/#pricing) to see everything you get and pricing.

(Also, because you’re awesome, you’ll get 10% off your first year. But don’t sign up for the discount; sign up because your privacy matters and you deserve the best email service out there.)
