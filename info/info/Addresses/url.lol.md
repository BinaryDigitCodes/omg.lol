# url.lol — Our Persistent URL Service

omg.lol lovingly operates a simple persistent URL (PURL) service at the domain [url.lol](https://url.lol). It is awesome.

## Privacy

url.lol respects your privacy. There are no cookies, tracking, or other garbage JS in use when visiting URL.LOL or being redirected. We’ll only anonymously count visits (by increasing the visit count by one)—that’s it.

## Redirection Preview

You can append `/wut` to any url.lol URL to view a preview screen prior to redirection. This will show you where you’re headed before you’re taken there, in case you want to know that you’re being Rickrolled before you’re actually Rickrolled.

## Abuse

We don’t tolerate spam or other shenanigans with url.lol. If you see anything bogus, please <a href="mailto:abuse@omg.lol">report it here</a>.
