# Referrals

We’re launching a referral program very soon! The details of the program aren’t quite finalized yet, but you can expect two key things:

1. You’ll be rewarded for every member that you refer to omg.lol.
2. We’ll apply rewards retroactively, all the way back to when the service launched.

<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-square-exclamation"></i> Let’s keep things nice!</h2>
<p>Hey, this is super important. <strong>The intent of the referral program is to reward members for referring new members to omg.lol.</strong> That’s it! This program isn’t designed to pursue aggressive growth or expand for expansion’s sake. We’d rather every referral be a fun, happy, natural (<em>organic</em>, as they say) thing vs. a forced or crappy thing.</p>
<p>We get it—people like rewards. You’re a person, so you probably like rewards too. But <em>please</em> do not make this program into something weird or gross for anyone. Don’t spam your referral URLs, don’t pressure or harass anyone to sign up for the service, and don’t do anything that anyone would generally find unpleasant in any way. We shouldn’t have to say this, but <em>definitely</em> don’t engage in any kind of cheating or exploitation in an attempt to reap extra rewards. We’ll catch it, and it won’t end well.</p>
<p>So, one last time: please do your part to keep the program fun and wholesome. Enjoy getting rewarded, but don’t make it uncool. Don’t make Prami sad.</p>

## Your referrals page

If you visit your [account settings](/account) page, you’ll see a new link at the top to access your [referrals page](/account/referrals). There, you can see and do the following:

1. Indicate who referred you to omg.lol, or if you’ve already done that, view confirmation of who referred you.
2. See and copy your referral URL(s).
3. See a list of everyone who you’ve referred to omg.lol.

## Referral URLs

You can refer people to omg.lol with a referral link that looks like this:

`https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/foobar` (where `foobar` is your omg.lol address)

If you have multiple addresses, you can use any of them for your referral URL. Your referrals page will list all of them, and you can click on the clipboard icon to copy them.

## Referral list

The list at the bottom of your referrals page shows everyone who has indicated that you’ve referred them to omg.lol, either by using your referral URL or by visiting their own referrals page and entering your address there (if you have more than one address, they could enter any of those addresses to give you credit).

If you’ve referred people to omg.lol and they’ve signed up but you don’t see their name in your list, ask them to visit their [referrals page](/account/referrals) and enter your address there.
