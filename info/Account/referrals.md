# Referral Program

Our referral program is super simple: for every person that you refer to omg.lol who signs up, we’ll give you three months of service credit. (See the “Program Details” section below for a little more info.)

## Your referrals page

If you visit your [account settings](/account) page, you’ll see a new link at the top to access your [referrals page](/account/referrals). On that page, you can say who referred you to omg.lol, or if you’ve already done that, view confirmation of who referred you. You can also see and copy your referral URL(s), and see a list of everyone who you’ve referred to omg.lol. Finally, you’ll also see your Time Bank—this is where your referral rewards appear.

## Time Bank

Your [Time Bank](/info/time-bank) shows the balance of credit that you’ve earned for referring people (three months per person). You can use the time in your Time Bank to generate omg.lol gift codes, and soon you’ll be able to use the time in other ways as well.

## Referral URLs

You can refer people to omg.lol with a referral link that looks like this:

`https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/foobar` (where `foobar` is your omg.lol address)

If you have multiple addresses, you can use any of them for your referral URL. Your referrals page will list all of them, and you can click on the clipboard icon to copy them.

## Referral list

The list at the bottom of your referrals page shows everyone who has indicated that you’ve referred them to omg.lol, either by using your referral URL or by visiting their own referrals page and entering your address there (if you have more than one address, they could enter any of those addresses to give you credit).

If you’ve referred people to omg.lol and they’ve signed up but you don’t see their name in your list, ask them to visit their [referrals page](/account/referrals) and enter your address there.

## Program Details

Here’s pretty much every detail about the program:

* You’ll receive three months of service credit for each person who signs up for omg.lol and either uses your referrer URL or lists you as their referrer on their referrals page.

* This program operates retroactively from the start of the service. You can receive credit for people who you referred years ago, as long as they sign in and list you as their referrer.

* The three months of service per referral is calculated as 91.5 days, which is one quarter of a leap year. Weird, yeah, but super fair!

* The balance in your Time Bank has no cash value. Your balance is surrendered when your omg.lol membership ends.

* Please don’t spam your referrer URLs or pester people to sign up for the service. We want to reward you for friendly, low-pressure referrals. Members who engage in referral spam or other unpleasant behavior related to the referral program will likely not be members for long.

* It should go without saying, but we have a zero-tolerance policy for any fraud or abuse related to the referral program. It won’t end well for anyone trying to game the system or engaging in any shenanigans. Please, just don’t.
