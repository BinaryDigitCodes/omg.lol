# Two-factor authentication

In June 2023 we said _good bye_ to passwords and two-factor authentication. With the revamp of our authentication flow, [passkeys](/info/passkeys) are now the default authentication method, with magic link support via email as a fallback. When you sign in, and can't use a passkey, we’ll email a unique link that will authenticate your session. We believe this is a much more secure approach, as passkeys are stronger and tamper resistant. No more passwords, no more awkward time-based 2FA codes — just passkeys with email fallback and smooth sailing into a safe, secure future together on the internet.
