# Passkeys

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) are secure, fast ways to access things online. Built on the [WebAuthn standard](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), passkeys combine the security of FIDO U2F security keys with your device’s biometrics, resulting in the ultimate authentication experience.

Fancy praise for the tech aside, passkeys are also a super simple replacement for passwords. And they can also replace usernames, too! omg.lol’s implementation allows you to sign in with the single click of a button, skipping username, password, and even your 2FA (if enabled). Because of the security involved in passkeys, these traditional authentication inputs are simply not needed. Welcome to the future.

If you’d like to dip your toes into the passkeys awesomeness, head on over to your [account page](/account) and add one there.
