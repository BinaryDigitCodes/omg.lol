# Passkeys

[Passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) are secure, fast ways to access things online. Built on the [WebAuthn standard](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), passkeys combine the security of FIDO U2F security keys with your device’s biometrics, resulting in the ultimate authentication experience.

Fancy praise for the tech aside, passkeys are also a super simple replacement for passwords. And they can also replace usernames, too! omg.lol’s implementation allows you to sign in with the single click of a button, skipping username, password, and even your 2FA (if enabled). Because of the security involved in passkeys, these traditional authentication inputs are simply not needed. Welcome to the future.

## Status

**omg.lol’s passkeys implementation is currently in beta**, or maybe even something more akin to a very rough alpha. It’s only been lightly tested in a minimum number of environments, so please proceed with caution if you opt to give it a try. Also, please [report any bugs](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bugs.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+) that you encounter when experimenting with passkeys on the site.

If you’d like to dip your toes into the passkeys awesomeness, head on over to your [account page](/account) and add one there.
