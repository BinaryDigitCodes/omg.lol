# Account Settings

All of your account settings can be managed in [a single convenient space](https://home.omg.lol/account).

Your account settings page is admittedly a bit busy (and we’ll do something about that at some point sooner than later), but there’s a general order to the things you’ll find there:

1. First up is some basic demographic stuff: your name and email address.
2. After that, you’ll find two security items: your password and 2FA settings.
3. Then, you’ll see some basic preference stuff: your contact preferences and preferred date format.
4. Then there’s a list of your active sessions (which you can sign out if you need to).
5. And then your settings for social.lol ([IRC](/info/irc) and [Mastodon](/info/mastodon)).
6. Application authorizations come after that.
7. And, finally, your API key.

Yeah, that really is a bit too much all in one space. Keep an eye out for a cleanup and reorganization soon!
