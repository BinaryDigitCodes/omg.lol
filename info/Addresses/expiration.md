# Address expiration

If you choose not to renew your omg.lol address, it will expire and be returned to the available pool of omg.lol addresses.

Hopefully you would only let your address expire because you decided that you no longer wanted it. To minimize accidents or forgetfulness, we send three reminders leading up to the expiration date:

1. The first one is sent 60 days before expiration.
2. The second is sent 30 days before expiration.
3. The third and final notification is sent 14 days before expiration.

Once your address expires, you’ll have a 14 day grace period to access or export any data (or change your mind and renew!). After 14 days, all of your data will be permanently deleted, and your address will be available for someone else to register.

If you have a Mastodon account on social.lol, you’ll have 14 days from the address expiration date to migrate your address to another instance. After 14 days, your Mastodon account will be permanently deleted. We’ll email anyone who has a Mastodon account to remind them of the account and to suggest that they migrate.
