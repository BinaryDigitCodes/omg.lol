# Disambiguation

When visiting an omg.lol address, you might encounter a page that tells you that “This URL could point to multiple places.” Don’t panic! This just means that there’s something to see in multiple places, and you get to choose which one you’d like to see. This happens whenever multiple things share the same name.

For example, `@foo` might have a [PURL](/info/purls) set up at `foo.url.lol/hello` that goes to a nice web page somewhere, but they might also have a pastebin entry at `foo.paste.lol/hello` that has some great information. If you visit `foo.omg.lol/hello`, we wouldn’t want to guess which one of those that you’d want to see, so we display a _disambiguation page_ so you can make the choice yourself.
