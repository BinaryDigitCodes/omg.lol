# Keybase Proofs

You can confirm your omg.lol address on [Keybase](https://keybase.io) through their proof system. It’s a pretty cool thing to do.

To get started, visit your Keybase profile page. Click **prove more identities**, and type "omg.lol" in the search field. Then click on it.

When prompted for your omg.lol username, enter your omg.lol address on its own. (Don’t enter your email address—just the address name by itself.)

Click the link provided to continue. If you’re not logged into omg.lol, go ahead and log in to complete the process. Your identity will be proven in no time flat!
