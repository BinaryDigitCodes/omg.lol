# About Addresses

Addresses are what omg.lol is all about. Your address is your identity, your chunk of real estate in the omg.lol namespace. Youâ€™ll see them sometimes referred to with the <i class="fa-solid fa-at"></i> prefix, like <i class="fa-solid fa-fw fa-at"></i>foobar, but they can also be represented as subdomains (foobar.omg.lol) and email addresses (foobar@omg.lol).

Addresses appear on your [Dashboard](/help/dashboard), but you can selectively hide them from there if you wish. Your dashboard also includes a link to your [Addresses](/addresses) page, which lists all of your addresses in one place and provides important information about each of them.
