<p id="tos-6-1"><span class="item-label">Section 6.1</span> This section shall not deprive you of any mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct Services to you, where you have your habitual residence.</p>

<p id="tos-6-2"><span class="item-label">Section 6.2</span> omg.lol and you (the “parties”) will attempt to settle any claim or controversy arising out of this Contract through consultation and negotiation in good faith and a spirit of mutual cooperation.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3"><span class="item-label">Section 6.3</span> If those attempts fail, then, except for disputes related to alleged patent, copyright, or trademark infringement, the dispute will be mediated in good faith by the parties by a mutually acceptable mediator to be chosen by omg.lol and you within thirty (30) days or any such period agreed to by the parties after written notice by the other demanding mediation. Such mediation is governed by the following:</p>

<div class="legal-section">

<p id="tos-6-3a"><span class="item-label">Part a.</span> Neither party may unreasonably withhold consent to the selection of a mediator, and omg.lol and you will share the costs of the mediation equally.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3b"><span class="item-label">Part b.</span> If the parties cannot agree to a choice of mediator, each party shall choose a non-conflicted neutral mediator and omg.lol shall flip a coin to decide which mediator shall be chosen.

<p id="tos-6-3c"><span class="item-label">Part c.</span> Venue for mediation shall be in a location within the United States that is mutually convenient and acceptable to the parties. If a venue for mediation cannot be mutually agreed upon then such mediation may be done conducted partially or wholly by teleconference or videoconference and the parties agree that nothing in this agreement requires any of the mediator, the parties or their lawyers to be physically present in the same room at the same time.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3d"><span class="item-label">Part d.</span> By mutual agreement, however, the parties may postpone mediation until they have each completed some specified but limited discovery about the dispute.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3e"><span class="item-label">Part e.</span> The parties may also agree to replace or supplement mediation with some other form of alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”), such as neutral fact-finding or arbitration.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3f"><span class="item-label">Part f.</span> Any dispute which the parties cannot resolve through negotiation, mediation, or other form of ADR within four (4) months of the date of the initial demand for it may then be submitted to a trier of fact identified in Section 6.5 for resolution.</p>

<p id="tos-6-3g"><span class="item-label">Part g.</span> The use of any ADR procedures will not be construed under the doctrines of latches, waiver, or estoppel to affect adversely the rights of either party. Nothing in this Article titled “Article 6: Governing Law, Venue, and Dispute Resolution” will prevent either party from resorting to judicial proceedings if (a) good faith efforts to resolve the dispute under these procedures have been unsuccessful or (b) interim relief from a court is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to one party or to others.</p>

</div>

<p id="tos-6-4"><span class="item-label">Section 6.4</span> You and omg.lol agree that the laws of the State of Kentucky, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-article-8">Article 8: Special Notices Related to Privacy Laws</h3>

<p id="privacy-8-1"><span class="item-label">Section 8.1</span> We provide this Policy to be transparent to our users.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-2"><span class="item-label">Section 8.2</span> We do not suggest, and this policy does not mean that, legal responsibilities apply that would not otherwise apply. Legal protections for personal information and what information is governed are different in many if not all jurisdictions, inside and outside and among the States, and localities of the United States. These laws are rapidly evolving and complex.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-3"><span class="item-label">Section 8.3</span> Not all laws, including collection notice requirements, apply to all entities, individuals, or information, in all locations, or in all circumstances. For example, omg.lol is not a “business” as so defined and regulated by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).</p>

<p id="privacy-8-4"><span class="item-label">Section 8.4</span> Without conceding that either the CCPA or any data privacy law outside the United States (like, but not limited to, those applying in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or Brazil) applies to data including personal information collected through our Services:</p>

<div class="legal-section">

<p id="privacy-8-4a"><span class="item-label">Part a.</span> We process (use) the personal information you give us by e-mailing us or in contact forms (e-mail address, other information you choose to provide) because, by contacting us and providing that information, you have authorized us to use it.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-4b"><span class="item-label">Part b.</span> We (and/or our contractors) process usage data, like number of page visits and IP addresses. That data is used for to, for example, understand usage of and manage our Services (which is within our legitimate interest), and otherwise as described in and pursuant to your consent to this Policy.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-4c"><span class="item-label">Part c.</span> We also process personal information wherever we have a legal obligation, for instance, if it is subpoenaed.</p>

</div>

<p id="privacy-8-5">Section 8.5 CCPA</p>

<div class="legal-section">

<p id="privacy-8-5a"><span class="item-label">Part a.</span> Entities which the CCPA defines as a “business” (which omg.lol is not) have special obligations to Californians including, for example, to respond to requests “to know,” for copies of “personal information” (as defined by the CCPA), and to delete it; to provide specific collection notices; if personal information is “sold,” to post a “do not sell” link and implement requests to opt-out of sale.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-5b"><span class="item-label">Part b.</span> omg.lol is not a “business” required to do so by the CCPA.</p>

</div>

<p id="privacy-8-6">Section 8.6 GDPR</p>

<div class="legal-section">

<p id="privacy-8-6a"><span class="item-label">Part a.</span> Individuals in certain jurisdictions outside the United States (for example “data subjects” in the EEA) have rights as to certain entities processing their “personal data” (for example, as defined by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) including, for example, to access, update, or delete it; to have it altered if inaccurate or incomplete; to object to processing or request a company restrict how it is processed; to withdraw consent to processing; to receive a copy, in a structured, machine-readable, and commonly used format; to complain to a data protection authority (a government agency) about management of personal data.</p>

<p id="privacy-8-6b"><span class="item-label">Part b.</span> omg.lol does not believe its processing of limited personal data of those outside the United States (if any) brings it within the jurisdiction of these laws.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="privacy-article-9">Article 9: Amendment of this Privacy Policy</h3>
