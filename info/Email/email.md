# Email Guide

Your omg.lol address comes with email forwarding. You can easily forward your emails sent to your address (e.g. `foobar@omg.lol`) to wherever you’d like, or take advantage of some more advanced email features if that’s your thing.

## Forwarding

To forward your emails, just pull up your address, click **Email**, and enter the destination address in the Forwarding field. You can enter as many addresses as you’d like (just separate them with a comma), and your inbound emails will be forwarded simultaneously to those destination addresses.

## Mail Log

You can view a helpful logfile of your recent email activity on your address’s Email screen. This will help you understand the email that’s been sent to your address and what happened to it once our mail server received it. The logs are limited and privacy-protecting (you can see where the message was coming from, but not much else).

## Address Delimiters

Some of the fancier email services out there let you use a `+` plus sign to extend your address, e.g. `foobar+thing@example.com`. That works with omg.lol as well, of course. But we’ve gone the extra mile and have opened up the range of characters that you can use to ``'*+/=?^_`{|}~.``, which means that addresses like `foobar/beep@omg.lol` and `foobar=bazbat@omg.lol` are perfectly valid. Have fun with those. (Note that messages sent to addresses extended with delimeters will not appear in your mail log due to the way the logs are parsed.)

## Sending

Aside from our [Fastmail](/info/fastmail) integration, we don’t support sending emails directly from your omg.lol address (yourname@omg.lol), as it’s intended to be used for forwarding only. But! You’re always in full control over your omg.lol domain name (yourname.omg.lol), so you’re welcome to configure that for use with any email service. Check out our guide on [Sending Email](/info/sending-email) for details on how to set that up.

## Mailhooks

We’re building an entirely new kind of programmable email service. When ready, you’ll be able to turn over your inbound email to our [Mailhooks](/info/mailhooks) feature, enabling powerful automated processing of emails and other fun stuff.
