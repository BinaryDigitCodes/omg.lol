# Keys

You can store and share your public keys with omg.lol. Just click on the Keys item on your address page, and you can manage all of your keys.

As of this writing, we fully support for PGP keys—but will be adding other key types soon.

## Web Key Directory

If you provide a PGP key containing your omg.lol email address, we’ll serve your key when any [Web Key Directory](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD) requests are received for it.
