# Keys

You can store and share your public keys with omg.lol. Just click on the Keys item on your address page, and you can manage your keys there.

As of this particular moment (a Tuesday evening), we support PGP and SSH keys—but will be adding other key types soon!

## Web Key Directory

If you provide a PGP key containing your omg.lol email address, we’ll serve your key when any [Web Key Directory](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD) requests are received for it. Web Key Directory is a new discovery scheme that makes it easy for people to find your key with your email address alone.

If you’re curious and want to play around with this, [there’s a very cool tool here](https://metacode.biz/openpgp/web-key-directory). That page also has some useful information about applications and service providers who are using Web Key Directory.
