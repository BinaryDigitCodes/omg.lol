# Classic Web Editor

Our Classic web editor is designed to make it easy to manage your profile page. Just fill in the predefined fields with as much (or as little) information as you’d like, add some [Profile Items](/info/profile-items), and you’re good to go.

When editing, be sure to click the **Publish** option to make your changes live. The preview on the editor is helpful for seeing how things are looking as you’re editing, but those changes won’t be visible to your visitors until you publish.

If you’re looking for a bit more control over your profile page, give our [Advanced editor](/info/advanced-editor) a spin! You’ll love it.
