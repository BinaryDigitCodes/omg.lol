# Profile Themes

Profile themes are pre-made chunks of CSS that can quickly and easily change the look of your profile. You can view a list of available themes on your profile settings page and see a small preview of each before making a selection.

Want to contribute your own theme? Check out the [README](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/blob/main/profiles/themes/README.md) in our theme repo.
