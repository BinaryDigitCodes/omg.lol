# Profiles

You can have a super awesome profile page on omg.lol. Enable yours by pulling up your address through the Dashboard, clicking **Web Page**, and you're all set!

## Getting Started

When you click **Web Page** for the first time, a screen asking if you want to use the [Advanced](info/advanced-editor) or [Classic](/info/classic-editor) Editor.
After that, you're set!

There’s a super powerful (we might even say _magical_) management process behind [Profile Items](/info/profile-items), so they have their [very own support article over here](/info/profile-items).

## Verified Profiles

If you see the official checkmark badge <i style="color: #0089cf;" class="fas fa-badge-check"></i> on a profile, it means that you’re viewing a verified profile. You can trust that the person is who they say they are! At least by our reasonable omg.lol standards, that is (lol).

If you’d like to be verified, just [contact us](/info/contact/) to kick off the process. We also sometimes automatically verify people who we know to be real, so if that happened to you, congrats!
