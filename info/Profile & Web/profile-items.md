# Profile Items

One of the best parts of an [omg.lol profile](/info/profiles) is the total flexibility you have in adding and managing your profile items.

Your profile items can be just about anything: plain text, a link to something (like a personal website or a social media profile), or whatever. Add as many as you’d like! You can re-order them any time by dragging them around.

## Adding items

Click the friendly green **Add an item** button to get a new field.

## Removing items

Want to nuke one of your items? Just clear the field, and when you save your profile it’ll be gone.

## Using Markdown

Markdown is supported, so you can format text or add links as you see fit. For example, you can add a link with custom text like this:

`[My awesome link text](https://myawesomesite.example.com)`

## Linking to social profiles or other sites

When you link to a known social profile or website, we’ll try to clean up the display of that link for you by showing a nice icon and your username (taken from the URL). If you’re not seeing a certain icon that you’re expecting, [get in touch](/info/contact) or [add a GitHub issue](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/issues/new) and we’ll add it for you.

## Special Items

- **PGP keys**. Drop your public key into a profile item field and we’ll display a fingerprint that links to the full key.
- **Email addresses**. Enter an email address and we’ll turn it into a working email link.

## Schemes

Schemes are ways to signal that your profile item is something specific, ensuring that they received the proper icon. Here are the schemes that you can use:

- `book://` to indicate the title of a book
- `game://` to indicate the title of a video game
- `tv://` to indicate the title of a TV show/series
- `film://` to indicate the title of a film
- `movie://` to indicate the title of a movie
- `cat://` to indicate the name of a pet cat
- `dog://` to indicate the name of a pet dog
- `discord://` for Discord usernames, e.g. `discord://Neatnik#9090`
- `mastodon://` for Mastodon usernames, e.g. `mastodon://@newbold@mastodon.social`
- `matrix://` for Matrix usernames, e.g. `matrix://@newbold:matrix.org`

Want to add a new scheme? [Add an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/neatnik/omg.lol/issues/new) or just [get in touch](/info/contact) to request one.
