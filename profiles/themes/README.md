# OMG.LOL Themes

This is a repository of themes for OMG.LOL profile pages. They’re just CSS files! Simple stuff.

If you’d like to submit your own theme for inclusion in the theme list, you can do it a couple of different ways:

1. Submit it here with a pull request.
2. Publish it in your own repo and share the repo URL (get in touch [here](https://meta.omg.lol/help/contact)).

More information about themes can be found in [this article](https://meta.omg.lol/help/profile-themes).
